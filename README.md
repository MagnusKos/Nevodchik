### What a strange name...
**Nevodchic** - from the old colloquial Russian word "не́водчик": a fisherman who catches fish with a seine ("невод").
So, a mesh, a seine. Both are latticed. Get it? Me neither...

### What is it for?
This application allows you to connect to an MQTT broker, format received packets with user messages in human-readable format, and send them to IRC and/or a connected Telegram bot.
The project is aimed at working with LoRa mesh networks. Currently, it is targeting Meshtastic.

### What else?
#### *TBA*
